# Currency-Converter
The Currency Converter project is a C language-based application designed to convert one countryâ€™s currency into another using predefined exchange rates. This tool allows users to input an amount, choose a source currency, and select a target currency to receive the converted value. The program uses basic C programming constructs such as functions, conditional statements, loops, and switch-case logic to handle multiple conversion scenarios. It features a simple menu-driven interface and ensures accurate conversion by applying appropriate arithmetic operations based on the selected currencies. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of user input handling, control flow, and modular programming, while also gaining practical insight into how real-world financial applications like currency converters operate.
